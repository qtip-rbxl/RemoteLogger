This script is intended to try and fix the issues of Solara v1, as it lacks certain functions that other RemoteSpy scripts use (SimpleSpy, Hydroxide, etc.)
It can only log remote calls from level 3 script levels. Meaning, **it will NOT log events from normal remotes.** It's not the script's fault; Solara's execution level is too low to capture all events fired in the game.

The script is currently in early beta, so _expect some bugs and confusion to come with the interface._
