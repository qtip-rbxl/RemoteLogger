This script is intended to try and fix the issues of Solara v1, as it lacks certain functions that other RemoteSpy scripts use (SimpleSpy, Hydroxide, etc.)
It can only log remote calls from level 3 script levels. Meaning, **it will NOT log normal remotes that you fire.**
It is currently in early beta, so _expect some bugs and confusion to come with the interface._
